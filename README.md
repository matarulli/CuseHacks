Cuse Hacks 2019 Application


  Within 24 hours, we were tasked to build something innovative. 
  With no idea what we were in for, we decided to make this application, Ad Astra.

Using expo to make react native programming easier, we made an application that is meant to display daily facts about space. Ranging from world news, private companies or celestial bodies, we wanted to appeal to the broadest range of people.

We featured original background art and logo to support our brand.

We hope this encourages a public interest in space and fosters a positive community for the future.
